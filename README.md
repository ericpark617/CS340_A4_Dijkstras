# CS340 Asignment 5: Dijkstra's Algorithm

This program takes a representation of a graph using distances between vertices and calculates the minimum cost from the source to each vertex in the graph.

# Repository Contents
- /Code_Files - Folder containing all the C++ files
- output.log - log of the output window running the program
- README.md - this readme file

# Usage
1. Compile and run the program using all the files in `Code_Files`.
2. Set the `vertexCount` in `dijkstras.h` to the number of vertices that are in your graph.
3. Input the distances from the source to each vertex in order.
